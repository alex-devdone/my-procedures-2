# Rules - instructions the AI MUST follow
# These are injected into every prompt
rules:
  - "Always use TypeScript with strict mode enabled"
  - "Use tRPC for all API endpoints to maintain end-to-end type safety"
  - "Use Drizzle ORM for all database operations - never write raw SQL unless absolutely necessary"
  - "Use Better-Auth for authentication - follow the patterns in packages/auth"
  - "All API inputs must be validated with Zod schemas"
  - "Follow Biome formatting and linting standards - run 'bun run check' before committing"
  - "Use Bun as the package manager, not npm or yarn"
  - "Follow the monorepo structure: apps/* for applications, packages/* for shared code"
  - "Use TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui for styling - maintain consistency with existing components"
  - "Add environment variables to both .env files and turbo.json env array"
